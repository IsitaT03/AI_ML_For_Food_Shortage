  Today, 124 million people experience crisis-levels of food insecurity. The amount of need has grown significantly over the last few years, straining the resources of the underfunded and overstressed international aid system. Famine and food shortages are caused by an amalgamation of climatic and socioeconomic factors. While the environment can affect the crop yield of a country, factors related to urbanization and infrastructure influence a populationâ€™s access to the crops. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have proven to be of great use in discovering patterns in prediction that escape the notice of human scientists and equations. With these techniques, food shortages can be predicted more efficiently and lives can be saved with preparation.

This project develops Machine Learning Models to predict Food Shortage using environmental and socioeconomic data from USDA, World Bank, UC Berkeley Earth, United Nations for 76 low-to-middle income countries in the years 2002-2016. Five algorithms were utilized: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Linear Discriminant Analysis, K-Nearest Neighbor. Along with Accuracy, Precision, and Recall, ROC graphs were generated to analyze the binary classification strength in terms of true-positive vs. false-positive rates. Feature importance was also analyzed to determine parameters with significant impact. Random Forest performed with the best accuracy of 95.3%. The most important features in determining food shortage vs. security were: Forest Land Percentage, Temperature, GDP, and Fertilizer Usage.

Based on the results, Machine Learning Algorithms are confirmed to accurately predict Food Shortage based on environmental and socioeconomic factors.
